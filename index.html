                <p class="information">* This information is estimated based on consumers who were approved for an auto refinance loan through Caribou on or after 1/1/2022, had an existing auto loan on their credit report, and accepted their final terms. As of 9/27/2022, borrowers who refinance save an average of $111.16 per month. Refinance savings may result from a lower interest rate, longer term, or both. There is no guarantee of savings. Your actual savings, if any, may vary based on interest rates, the repayment term, the amount financed, and other factors.</p>

            <div class="commet_end_2">
                <p class="check">+ To check the refinance rates and terms you qualify for, we conduct a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. However, if you choose a loan product and continue your application, we or one of our lending partners will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, which is considered a hard credit pull and may affect your credit.</p>

                <p class="annual">** APR is the Annual Percentage Rate. Your actual APR may be different. Your APR is based on multiple factors including your credit profile and the loan to value of the vehicle. APR ranges from 2.83% to 36.00% and is determined at the time of application. Lowest APR is based on loan amount of $45,000, 36 month term, and is available to borrowers with excellent credit and only in certain states. Conditions apply. Advertised rates and fees are valid as of 11/1/2022 and are subject to change without notice. Insurance savings will not result from lower APR.</p>
